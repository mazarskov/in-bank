Intern did a great job with TICKET - 101, especially with commenting, every function has a very detailed and understandable description. Every function written by them was tested and worked well.

However, they failed to implement one of the requirements of TICKET-101. That is a Scoring algorithm. I implemented it and added the necessary error handling, to both, main and test.
